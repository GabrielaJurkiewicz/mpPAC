1. Authors and copyrights

This EEGLAB plugin was written by Gabriela Jurkiewicz and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Appliance

This software implements algorithm for detection of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling to be used in data analysis under EEGLAB toolbox. Program allows a
user to perform calculations and indicate the path where the results will be saved. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage

To use this software you need:
- Matlab, version 2011a or newer
- Eeglab, version 11_0_4_3b or newer
- mp-eeglab-plugin, version 0.4 freely available at https://git.nimitz.pl/mp-eeglab-plugin.git

To install this plugin you need to place its entire directory inside the eeglab-directory/plugins/,
where eeglab-directory is a directory in which your eeglab is located.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Functionalities

After installation you should be able to locate this plugin in the eeglab main menu under Tools > Phase Amplitude Coupling analysis.
This software for now consists of only one functionality:

- calculate mMVL (pac_calc.m) - calculates the modified Mean Vector Length (mMVL) for a given data and saves the results in the localization indicated by the user. 
The results consists of images summarizing the analysis, MAT structure containing the results and MAT structure containing the configuration parameters. 
It requires several parameters as an input - check documentation for details. This procedure is also accessible by pop_pac_calc.m - recommended.

There is an examplary program (Test.m) and data set (TestData.set) that show the results for simulated signal consisted of 6 Hz sinus with superimposed bursts 
of 77 Hz oscillation located just before the top of each sinus cycle with added white noise.

5. mMVL algorithm for phase-amplitude coupling detection

The mMVL algorithm is based on analysis of time-frequency representation of signals aligned to a given phase in the low-frequency band. 
Low frequency wave is obtained with Matching Pursuit algorithm by selecting waveforms of interest. The time-frequency representation of signalï¿½s energy density is 
derived from continuous wavelet transform, and normalized at each frequency relative to its average value in the baseline period. 
Next, the representation is thresholded at values obtained from a surrogate data. The resulting maps are used to compute comodulograms. 
The effects presented in the comodulograms are validated with extreme values statistics.
